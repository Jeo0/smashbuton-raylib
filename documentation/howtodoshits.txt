how the game works
	READY MODE:
		press wasd if player 1 is present
		press i jk I if player2 is present
		if both are present, proceed to COOLDOWN MODE

	COOLDOWN MODE:
		a random number will appear (pls name it POGISIJESSIE)
		wait for 1.5 seconds
		clear screen
	
	SHOWDOWN MODE:
		- 8 inputs (wasd for leftPlayer, ijkl for rightPlayer)
		appear 4 choices for playerl and player2:
			- 2 choices will equal to POGISIJESSIE if both are added
			- 2 choices are random

		- remove the inputs in an array
		- record the inputs in an array with a size of 2 unsigned integers
		- IF "wrong combination", then dont let the player input anything yet for 0.5 seconds
		- IF "clashFlag is true", then 
		- IF "right combination", then minus one health
		- present the match points after, and then go back to COOLDOWN MODE


	REWARDING PHASE:
	(repeat showdown mode 5 times)
		show sino nanalo with the highest match points
